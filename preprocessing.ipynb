        "Increasing the size of the voxel grid to (128, 128, 128) will have several implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "Increased Memory Usage: Larger voxel grids require more memory to store both during training and inference. This means you'll need more RAM or VRAM, depending on whether you're training on CPU or GPU, respectively.\n",
        "Higher Computational Complexity: With a larger grid, the number of voxels to process increases significantly. This leads to higher computational complexity for both the generator and discriminator networks, resulting in longer training times per iteration.\n",
        "Architecture Adjustments: The architectures of the generator and discriminator networks will need to be adjusted to accommodate the larger input and output dimensions. For example, you may need to increase the number of layers, filters, or neurons in the networks to handle the increased complexity.\n",
        "Training Stability: Larger voxel grids may lead to training instability, especially in the early stages of training. Techniques such as gradient clipping, batch normalization, and spectral normalization may be necessary to stabilize training.\n",
        "Data Requirements: Generating high-resolution voxel grids requires more detailed and diverse training data to capture the complexity of real-world objects accurately. Ensure that your dataset is large and varied enough to support training with the larger voxel grid size effectively.\n",
        "Evaluation Metrics: When evaluating the quality of generated models, consider using metrics that account for the increased resolution, such as voxel-based metrics or perceptual metrics like Frechet Inception Distance (FID) adapted for 3D data.\n",
        "Hardware Limitations: Finally, ensure that your hardware can handle the increased memory and computational demands of training with larger voxel grids. High-performance GPUs with ample VRAM are typically required for training deep learning models with large inputs.\n",
        "Overall, while increasing the voxel grid size to (128, 128, 128) may lead to higher-quality 3D model generation, it also comes with challenges related to memory usage, computational complexity, and training stability. Balancing these factors is essential for successful training and generation of high-fidelity 3D models."
